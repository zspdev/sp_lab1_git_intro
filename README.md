First of all, we created the main branch. Then, we added the collaborators and also created a personal branch for every collaborator (branch_collaborator).

In the main branch we created a story.txt file and a README.md markdown file. Each contributor pulled the main branch into their own personal branch. There, each of us created a personal story .txt file (collaborator_story.txt) and each collaborator filled it with its personal stories. The next step was to add and commit it. Then, it was pushed into our branch. After that, from our branches we pushed our version of story.txt into the main branch story.txt. This caused conflicts. The administrator of the repository resolved the conflicts, therefore we got a complete story.txt file in the main branch where all of our personal stories could be found.

The commits used could be found in the log since the repository is public.
